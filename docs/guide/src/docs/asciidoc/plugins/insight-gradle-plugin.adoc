Records information about the build and outputs reports at the end of the build.

Reports must implement the `org.kordamp.gradle.plugin.insight.model.BuildReport` interface. A report of type
`org.kordamp.gradle.plugin.insight.reports.SummaryBuildReport` will be configured by default if no other reports are
explicitly configured.

=== SummaryBuildReport
`org.kordamp.gradle.plugin.insight.reports.SummaryBuildReport` accepts the following configuration properties:

.Project State

A Project may be in any of the following states:

[horizontal]
SUCCESS:: All its tasks succeeded.
FAILURE:: At least one of its task failed.
SKIPPED:: None of its tasks were executed.
PARTIAL:: Some tasks were executed.

==== Formats
.Short

The short format displays:

 * project path
 * project configuration time
 * project execution time.

WARNING: Project execution time is reported in *linear time*, as the sum of the execution time of all its tasks.

.Long

The long format displays the same information as the short format plus a table of task states.

[horizontal]
TOT:: Total number of tasks in the project.
EXE:: Number of tasks executed.
FLD:: Number of tasks failed.
SKP:: Number of tasks skipped.
UTD:: Number of tasks that are up to date.
WRK:: Number of tasks that did work.
CHD:: Number of tasks retrieved from cache.
NSR:: Number of tasks with no source.
ACT:: Number of actionable tasks.

.Examples

Figure 1. shows a successful build for a project with 4 submodules

.`$ gm build`
image::build-summary-short1.png[align="center"]

Figure 2. shows a failed build where a failed test in `project1` prevents other projects from being executed

.`$ gm build`
image::build-summary-short2.png[align="center"]

Figure 3. shows the same failure but `project2` and `project3` are marked as PARTIAL because some of their tasks
were invoked.

.`$ gm clean build`
image::build-summary-short3.png[align="center"]

Figures 4., 5., and 6. show the previous scenarios but using the long format

.`$ gm build`
image::build-summary-long1.png[align="center"]

.`$ gm build`
image::build-summary-long2.png[align="center"]

.`$ gm clean build`
image::build-summary-long3.png[align="center"]

Figure 7. shows another project where a subset of modules was invoked. The `griffon-javafx` project has long running
tests and hit the default execution threshold of 2 minutes

.`$ gm :griffon-javafx:test`
