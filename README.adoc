A set of opinionated Gradle plugins that provide common behavior observed in Maven, and more!

== Usage

Option #1
[source,groovy]
[subs="attributes"]
----
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
        gradlePluginPortal()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath '{project-group}:{plugin-id}:{plugin-version}'
    }
}
apply plugin: '{plugin-id}'
----

Option #2
[source,groovy]
[subs="attributes"]
----
plugins {
    id '{plugin-id}' version '{plugin-version}'
}
----

Where `{plugin-id}` stands for any of the ids described in the following section. Most times it's enough to simply apply
the `{project-group}.project` at the root. All plugins may be applied independently as well.

Refer to the link:http://{project-owner}.github.io/{project-name}[guide, window="_blank"] for further information on configuration
and usage.

== Requirements

 * Java 8
 * Gradle 5+
